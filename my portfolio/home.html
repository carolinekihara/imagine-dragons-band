                <h3>About The Programmer</h3>
              <p>Kihara writes and tests code that allows computer applications and programs to function. She may translate designs from software developers and engineers into workable code. She may also update or expand the code of existing programs or test programs for errors, finding and resolving faulty lines of code.</p>
              <p>Kihara works in many settings, including corporate information technology ("IT") departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. She also works for consulting companies at client sites as a contractor. Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a profession authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).

                Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision.</p>
